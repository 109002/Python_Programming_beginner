- Introduction to Python and its popularity.
- Overview of Python's applications (Web Development, Data Science, Automation, etc.).
- Setting up Python on your system (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- Introduction to Python IDEs (PyCharm, VS Code, Jupyter Notebook).

**Examples:**
1. Install Python on your system.
2. Open the Python interpreter and run `print("Hello, World!")`.
3. Explore the Python official website (python.org).
4. Install an IDE like VS Code and set up a Python environment.
5. Run a simple script in your IDE.

## **Python Intro**
Python was created by **Guido van Rossum** and released in 1991. It is an interpreted language, meaning code is executed line-by-line.

### **2. Python Intro**
**Content:**
- What is Python? (High-level, interpreted, and object-oriented language).
- Python's history and key features (readability, simplicity, versatility).
- Python 2 vs Python 3.
- Basic structure of a Python program.

**Examples:**
1. Write a program to print your name.
2. Use Python as a calculator (e.g., `print(5 + 3 * 2)`).
3. Explain the difference between Python 2 and Python 3.
4. Write a program to display the current date and time.
5. Print a multi-line string using triple quotes.

### **Example 1: Hello World**
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

### **Example 2: Basic Math Operations**
```python
print(5 + 3)
print(10 / 2)
```

### **Example 3: Assigning Variables**
```python
x = 5
y = "Python"
print(x, y)
```

### **Example 4: Checking Python Version**
```python
import sys
print(sys.version)
```

### **Example 5: Simple If Statement**
```python
age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
```

---

## **Python Get Started**
To get started, install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### **3. Python Get Started**
**Content:**
- Writing your first Python program.
- Running Python scripts from the command line.
- Understanding the Python interpreter.
- Using Python in interactive mode.

**Examples:**
1. Create a file `hello.py` and write `print("Hello, Python!")`.
2. Run the script from the terminal using `python hello.py`.
3. Use the Python interactive shell to perform calculations.
4. Write a script to take user input and display it.
5. Run a Python script with command-line arguments.

### **Running Python Code**
- Use the **Python shell** (`python` command)
- Write scripts (`.py` files) and run them using `python filename.py`

### **Example 1: Running a Python Script**
Create a file `script.py`:
```python
print("Python script executed!")
```
Run it using:
```bash
python script.py
```

### **Example 2: Using Python in the Interactive Shell**
```python
>>> print("Hello from the shell!")
```

### **Example 3: Installing a Package**
```bash
pip install requests
```

### **Example 4: Checking Installed Packages**
```python
import pkg_resources
installed_packages = [pkg.key for pkg in pkg_resources.working_set]
print(installed_packages)
```

### **Example 5: Writing Multi-line Code in Python Shell**
```python
if True:
    print("Line 1")
    print("Line 2")
```

---
### **4. Python Syntax**
**Content:**
- Indentation and code blocks.
- Python statements and expressions.
- Rules for writing Python code (case sensitivity, identifiers, etc.).
- Common syntax errors and how to avoid them.

**Examples:**
1. Write a program with proper indentation (e.g., an `if` statement).
2. Demonstrate incorrect indentation and fix it.
3. Use multiple statements in a single line separated by semicolons.
4. Write a program with a syntax error and debug it.
5. Use comments to explain the syntax of a program.


## **Python Syntax**
Python syntax is simple and follows indentation instead of `{}` like in C/C++.


### **Example 1: Proper Indentation**
```python
if 5 > 2:
    print("Five is greater than two")
```

### **Example 2: Comments in Code**
```python
# This is a comment
print("Hello, Python!")  # This is another comment
```

### **Example 3: Case Sensitivity**
```python
x = 5
X = 10
print(x, X)  # 5 10
```

### **Example 4: Multi-line Statements**
```python
total = 1 + \
        2 + \
        3
print(total)
```

### **Example 5: Multi-line Strings**
```python
text = """This is a 
multi-line string."""
print(text)
```

---
### **5. Python Comments**
**Content:**
- Importance of comments in code.
- Single-line comments (`#`).
- Multi-line comments (`'''` or `"""`).
- Best practices for writing comments.

**Examples:**
1. Add a single-line comment to explain a variable.
2. Use multi-line comments to describe a function.
3. Write a program with comments explaining each step.
4. Comment out a block of code to prevent execution.
5. Use comments to mark TODOs in your code.


## **Python Comments**
Python supports single-line and multi-line comments.

### **Example 1: Single-Line Comment**
```python
# This is a comment
print("Python is fun!")
```

### **Example 2: Multi-Line Comment using Triple Quotes**
```python
"""
This is a multi-line comment.
It spans multiple lines.
"""
print("Multi-line comments example")
```

### **Example 3: Using Comments to Disable Code**
```python
# print("This line won't run")
print("This line will run")
```

### **Example 4: Docstrings as Comments**
```python
def greet():
    """This function prints a greeting."""
    print("Hello!")
greet()
```

### **Example 5: Commenting Out a Block of Code**
```python
# x = 10
# y = 20
# print(x + y)  # This won't execute
```

---

## **Python Variables**
Variables store data in Python.

### **Example 1: Declaring Variables**
```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
print(name, age)
```

### **Example 2: Multiple Assignments**
```python
x, y, z = 1, 2, 3
print(x, y, z)
```

### **Example 3: Assigning the Same Value**
```python
a = b = c = 10
print(a, b, c)
```

### **Example 4: Variable Types**
```python
x = 10      # int
y = 3.14    # float
z = "Hello" # str
print(type(x), type(y), type(z))
```

### **Example 5: Dynamic Typing**
```python
x = 10
print(type(x))  # int
x = "Python"
print(type(x))  # str
```

---

### **7. Python User Input**
**Content:**
- Taking input from the user using `input()`.
- Converting input to different data types (int, float, etc.).
- Handling user input errors.
- Writing interactive programs.

**Examples:**
1. Ask the user for their name and greet them.
2. Take two numbers as input and display their sum.
3. Convert user input from string to integer.
4. Handle invalid input using `try` and `except`.
5. Create a simple calculator that takes user input.


## **Python User Input**
Python allows user input using `input()`.

### **Example 1: Basic Input**
```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello, " + name)
```

### **Example 2: Taking Integer Input**
```python
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
print("You are", age, "years old")
```

### **Example 3: Taking Float Input**
```python
price = float(input("Enter price: "))
print("The price is:", price)
```

### **Example 4: Input with Type Checking**
```python
data = input("Enter something: ")
print("You entered:", data, "of type", type(data))
```

### **Example 5: Input and Processing**
```python
num1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))
sum_result = num1 + num2
print("Sum:", sum_result)
```
